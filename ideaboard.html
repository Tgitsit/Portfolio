                        <h3> The gist</h3>
                        <p>You are online and you find an interesting image for future reference. How do you save it? Do you create a google doc with a number of links? You cannot preview them, so when you try to access it- it’s just a sea of links! How frustrating. Sure, you can use Evernote, or Dropbox Paper or Pintrest… but what if you want to keep on adding links, move images around, compare them, change sizes, put text on it? Currently, creatives have to use multiple applications to keep their ideas. <mark class="blue"> Idea Board is a one stop solution for all those needs.</mark></p>

                        I had 1.5 months for the completion of this project.</p>

We don't even have a target audience in mind really. We really need your thoughts on all this as we see an opportunity here that plays to our core strengths, but we need you to help us bring it to market.
