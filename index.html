                        <h3> The gist</h3>
                        <p>My client, AB Mauri, was introducing Australia's famous Burgen bread to the United States. They enlisted me to create a video for the launch. The end product was not only an award-winning video featured on AB Mauri’s landing page, but also a streamlined process for future content creation.</p>
                        <h3> My role </h3>
                        <p>As creative director, I was in charge of designing and executing the content based on the client's requirements. That included writing a creative brief, working with a copywriter to tell the story of Burgen bread, leading conception of the video’s look and feel, and finalizing all of the audio and graphical elements.</p>

                    <h1>Challenges</h1> 
                        <p>Each project has its own set of unique challenges to overcome. Here are a few of the ones our team faced in this project.</p>
                        <h3> 1: Telling a winning story</h3>
                        <p>Creating a video for a product launch is all about storytelling. Which facets of the product do we highlight for the consumer? Getting all stakeholders on the same page about the content is half the battle.</p>
                        <h3>2: Crafting visuals that fit the narrative.</h3>
                        <p>My team previously created a video for AB Mauri to celebrate 150 years of Fleischmann's Yeast. The video was nominated for a Suncoast Regional Emmy and won gold at the Telly Awards the year before. Needless to say, the client wanted me to use similar visuals, but give it a modern twist.
                        </p>
                         <figure class="hero_video">
                            <div class="video-responsive">
                            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/255140652?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </div>
                            <figcaption> Telly Award Winner and Emmy Nominated "150 Years of Flieschmanns".</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Fleischmann's has a rich history of print media advertising. To celebrate their 150th anniversary, we used cutouts from the original print ads in the video. It worked perfectly for the story we were telling. 2.5D cutouts work best with historical content. The challenge with Burgen was finding a way to smoothly marry two seemingly-opposed elements: older, historical visuals with fresh bread and the lush New Zealand countryside.</p>
                        <h3> 3: Process is essential</h3>
                        <p>Content creation is like solving a puzzle. Each part affects the next one. Employing a system key to this project's success. We devised specific workflows and conventions for everything from file naming to subject lines for emails.</p>
                        <h3>4: Time management</h3>
                        <p>We had a small team and a relatively small budget for the scope of the work, so I was also personally involved in the creation of some motion graphic components and visual design. That made time management essential.

                    <h1>Our Process</h1> 
                        <p>The first step of the design process involved understand client's requirements and how competitors positioned themselves. Then, we created a moodboard and script.  Once that was approved, it was time to create visual elements, like stylesheets and storyboards. We created animatics for complex shots and created the final animation. Once the picture was locked, it was time to record the voiceover, compose music, sound effects and create the final mix.</p>

                    <p>The client wanted to create a video about 2:30 long, about bringing Burgen bread to America. </p>
                    <p>They were flexible in terms of the look. They did want to make sure it was colorful, but stay in the similar 2.5d realm as we did for the "150 Years of Fleischmann's" video. </p>
                    <p>The target market was health-conscious consumers, people who shop at Whole Foods, between the ages of 25 and 60.</p>

                    <p>Photographs were going to be a significant portion of the video, and we needed to figure out how to add motion to the photos. We didn't want to go the usual puppet tool route. In one of the brainstorming sessions, we discussed unrolling paper like a scroll. </p>
                    <p>We used stop motion compositions to achieve this look. </p>

                    <p>Typically, we try out ideas in the storyboard phase, but sometimes that's not enough. In this case, we knew that the opening of the video had to be perfect, so we created a few animatics before we finalized it.</p>
                    <h3> The Opening Shot</h3>
                    <p>First impressions count. Apart from successfully establishing the tone and rhythm of the entire narrative, the open should also capture the viewer’s interest. Using New Zealand presented our team with a wide variety of choices, from lush greenery to exotic culture. The challenge was introducing it in seconds, without losing the breezy feel of the script. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes, the smallest tweaks make the biggest impact. </p>
                    <p>The storyboard worked, but something was missing. The eureka moment came in the form of an image of a Maori Chief by the artist Sydney Parkinson. Taking inspiration from his face tattoo, we decided to use dotted lines as connecting elements from frame to frame. That's it. This relatively small change made all the difference!
