                        <h3> The gist</h3>
                        <p>My client, AB Mauri, was introducing Australia's famous Burgen bread to the United States. They enlisted me to create a video for the launch. The end product was not only an award-winning video featured on AB Mauri’s landing page, but also a streamlined process for future content creation.</p>
                        <h3> My role </h3>
                        <p>As creative director, I was in charge of designing and executing the content based on the client's requirements. That included writing a creative brief, working with a copywriter to tell the story of Burgen bread, leading conception of the video’s look and feel, and finalizing all of the audio and graphical elements.</p>

                    <h1>Challenges</h1> 
                        <p>Each project has its own set of unique challenges to overcome. Here are a few of the ones our team faced in this project.</p>
                        <h3> 1: Telling a winning story</h3>
                        <p>Creating a video for a product launch is all about storytelling. Which facets of the product do we highlight for the consumer? Getting all stakeholders on the same page about the content is half the battle.</p>
                        <h3>2: Crafting visuals that fit the narrative.</h3>
                        <p>My team previously created a video for AB Mauri to celebrate 150 years of Fleischmann's Yeast. The video was nominated for a Suncoast Regional Emmy and won gold at the Telly Awards the year before. Needless to say, the client wanted me to use similar visuals, but give it a modern twist.
                        </p>
                         <figure class="video">
                            <div class="video-responsive">
                            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/255140652?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </div>
                            <figcaption> Telly Award Winner and Emmy Nominated "150 Years of Flieschmanns".</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Fleischmann's has a rich history of print media advertising. To celebrate their 150th anniversary, we used cutouts from the original print ads in the video. It worked perfectly for the story we were telling. 2.5D cutouts work best with historical content. The challenge with Burgen was finding a way to smoothly marry two seemingly-opposed elements: older, historical visuals with fresh bread and the lush New Zealand countryside.</p>
                        <h3> 3: Process is essential</h3>
                        <p>Content creation is like solving a puzzle. Each part affects the next one. Employing a system key to this project's success. We devised specific workflows and conventions for everything from file naming to subject lines for emails.</p>
                        <h3>4: Time management</h3>
                        <p>We had a small team and a relatively small budget for the scope of the work, so I was also personally involved in the creation of some motion graphic components and visual design. That made time management essential.

                    <h1>Our Process</h1> 
                        <p>The first step of the design process involved understand client's requirements and how competitors positioned themselves. Then, we created a moodboard and script.  Once that was approved, it was time to create visual elements, like stylesheets and storyboards. We created animatics for complex shots and created the final animation. Once the picture was locked, it was time to record the voiceover, compose music, sound effects and create the final mix.</p>

                    <h1>Discovery</h1> 
                    <p>The client wanted to create a video about 2:30 long, about bringing Burgen bread to America. </p>
                    <p>They were flexible in terms of the look. They did want to make sure it was colorful, but stay in the similar 2.5d realm as we did for the "150 Years of Fleischmann's" video. </p>
                    <p>The target market was health-conscious consumers, people who shop at Whole Foods, between the ages of 25 and 60.</p>

                    <h1>Script</h1> 
                    <p>Everything in the project must serve the story. For our team, the first step was to review every aspect of the product and list all its essential components, then group elements together to create a story arc.</p>
                    <p>The focus of the piece was becoming clear. We would talk about the natural ingredients that our customers value. We settled on the theme that Burgen bread is “Positively delicious bread that fits in with your healthy lifestyle."</p>

                    <p>The storyboard worked, but something was missing. The eureka moment came in the form of an image of a Maori Chief by the artist Sydney Parkinson. Taking inspiration from his face tattoo, we decided to use dotted lines as connecting elements from frame to frame. That's it. This relatively small change made all the difference!

                    <p>Sometimes, the best course is to change course. </p>
                    <p>The core idea was to establish bread as a constant through time, and Burgen's contribution in perfecting the flavors while holding firm to the tradition. Once put on frame properly, the bread slice silhouette formed the background loops nicely. </p>
                    <p>We began by illustrating the bread and grains, but after rendering it, we realized this approach wouldn't work. We wanted to highlight Burgen’s use of real ingredients, and an illustration didn’t match that goal. Instead, we chose photo-realistic 3D, which looked more lifelike. We brought in a 3D specialist to complete that shot.</p>

                    <h1> Voiceover</h1>
                    <p>Our client wanted an authentic, New Zealand accent for the voiceover, so we auditioned several U.S.-based voiceover artists. Some of them had even moved to the U.S. from New Zealand, but we struggled to find a perfect fit.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it dawned on me: Where can I find talent with an authentic New Zealand accent? In New Zealand, of course!  </p>
                    <p>I found an agency from Auckland and worked directly with them on getting the voiceover recorded. With an 18-hour time difference, finding time on everyone's calendar was another challenge, but the final result was worth it. </p>

                    <p>We initially wanted to use Dave Dobbyn's "Slice of Heaven" as our background track. He’s a famous musician from New Zealand, but the price tag was way beyond our budget. Our composer, Miriam Mayer, saved the day. She recorded a track capturing the spirit of that song. And voila! It worked. </p>

The story – one that started in New Zealand nearly 40 years ago – is both exciting and something you can feel good about from a product standpoint. Studio T Creative has once again captured the background details and created a visually-inspired short film to tell that story, and we’re thrilled about the outcome that includes a prestigious Davey Award for visual excellence.” </p>

                    <h1>Key Takeaways</h1> 
                        <p>A project with a limited budget, time frame and small team is always a learning experience. I am grateful to be a part of it. In the end, we were able to carefully analyze the task, prepare and create systems to succeed, celebrate the wins, make tweaks where necessary to bounce back from misjudgments and learn from our mistakes. 
                        </p>
                        <h3> 1: Collaboration is key</h3>
                        <p>I learned the most valuable thing on any given project is the attitude of the people working on it. For a truly collaborative environment, we all had to be ready to let our guard down and check our egos at the door (or – in our case – outside the Skype call!)</p>
                        <h3>2: It's OK to change course</h3>
                        <p>We changed the shot of bread from 2D to photo-realistic 3D. We did this even after the initial approval from the client. We have an excellent relationship with our client and were able to discuss the pros and cons of using photo-real 3D and the impact it would have on the overall piece. Sometimes, you just have to let go of the sunk cost.</p>
                        <h3> 3: Process is essential</h3>
                        <p>We learned early on that the only way for our team of our size to manage all the moving parts of a project like this was to develop an efficient, standard workflow for each element, including uniform file names and email subject lines, shared assets and notes and so on. Without that, things can fall through the cracks, costing time and energy to go back and clean up those small mistakes. If we hadn’t done that, this project would not have been so successful. That’s a lesson I’ll apply to every future project.</p>
