                    <h4> The gist:</h4>
                    <p>My client, AB Mauri, was introducing Australia's famous Burgen bread to the United States. They enlisted me to create a video for the launch. The end product was not only an award-winning video featured on AB Mauri’s landing page, but also a streamlined process for future content creation.</p>
                    <h4> My role: </h4>
                    <p>As creative director, I was in charge of designing and executing the content based on the client's requirements. That included writing a creative brief, working with a copywriter to tell the story of Burgen bread, leading conception of the video’s look and feel, and finalizing all of the audio and graphical elements.</p>
