                <p.bold> The gist:</p.bold>
                <p>My client, AB Mauri, was introducing Australia's famous Burgen bread to the United States. They enlisted me to create a video for the launch. The end product was not only an award-winning video featured on AB Mauri’s landing page, but also a streamlined process for future content creation.

                <p.bold> My role: </p.bold>
                <p>As creative director, I was in charge of designing and executing the content based on the client's requirements. That included writing a creative brief, working with a copywriter to tell the story of Burgen bread, leading conception of the video’s look and feel, and finalizing all of the audio and graphical elements.
