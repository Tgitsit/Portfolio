                        <p>I collaborated with remote teams, including designers, developers, data scientists, and marketers, to determine product strategy.  I was in-charge of designing Home, Search-Result and FAQ pages. My tasks included conducting user research, creating personas, wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, responsive interface design, and prototypes.</p>
                        <h3> Prelude </h3>
                        <p class="nopad">By February 2020, COVID-19 is spreading widely across the U.S. W.H.O. has declared it a pandemic, and several countries, including the U.S., are in a lockdown. The reason- the virus is airborne and spreads quickly. There are no treatments yet, and the vaccine will take at least 18 months to become available- that is, if everything goes right. </p>
                        <p class="nopad">All experts agree the best way fight the virus to test as much as possible. In the U.S., the procedures and requirements for each testing center differed and varied across States. There is no central directory for testing locations and requirements.</p>

What are the basic requirements to get tested in your area? Do you need insurance? Do you have to pay for it?

It also provides key information like distance, appointments required, pre-screening required, etc. You can filter by the type of location, in-facility or drive through. The new updates will include turnaround time and cost.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2> 
                        <p>Challenges make us re-think our strategies, forcing us to up the game. Here are a few our team faced in this project.</p>
                        <h3> 1: Ticking clock</h3>
                        <p> Time was of the essence. We wanted to be up and running as soon as possible. I was the first designer on the team. By the time I joined, the site was live- it needed a lot of work as they were using a bootstrap template. However, re-coding everything from scratch wasn't an option at the moment. <strong>So my first goal was to work within the parameters of that template. Make the information accessible and understandable with minimal changes. </strong></p>
                        <h3>2: Remote team on different timezones</h3>
                        <p>We were also working remotely with over 30 volunteers from around the world.  Co-ordinating everyone to be on the same page in different time zones was a challenge — that ultimately led to a very fulfilling experience.

                    <p> <strong>The Curious Bunch</strong> they don't have any symptoms but want to keep an eye and know what's going on in regards to COVID-19 testings. </p>

                                <p>She has been feeling sick. She has recently found out that one of her employers has COVID-19.  So she has needed to get tested. She is uninsured, so she is trying to find a location that will not charge her for the test.</p>

                                    <li><p>Many testing centers ask you to get more information from your doctor’s office. Martha doesn’t have insurance and no family physician she could call. </p></li>

                    <h2>Data and Insights</h2>
                    <p>As our database grows, so do our insights.  We've even begun eye-tracking with Crazy Egg to understand how the users were navigating through the site. We synthesized our observations to the following:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Display full info from testing sites</h3>
                    <p> Many centers provide specific information that was unique to the center, so it is necessary to display it in its entirety.</p>
                    <h3>Lose "In-Facility testing"</h3>
                    <p>All centers are in-facility centers, and a few of them have drive-through available OR are just drive-through pop up centers. So, the differentiator is drive-through. We do not need to display in-facility testing as a feature.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Bring back Home Page</h3>
                    <p>Crazy Egg recordings show the bounce rate after punching in the zip-code is high. We suspect that even though we scroll to the search-results, we need to give better feedback to the users. We need to separate the landing page and the search results page.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Add pagination</h3>
                    <p>The testing centers in our database is growing, so it is essential to add pagination. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Get help</h3>
                    <p>Even with the amount of data we were scraping, we needed people to suggest centers that we missed. So the process of recommending a center or pointing out an error in our database has to be prominent. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Work in progress</h3>
                    <p>We were also planning to add more information like how long does a test center takes to process your results? Do they do antibody testing? Do they charge for the test? Etc. We need to add sort and filter options, so people find it easy to search for things that they're looking for.

                    <p>The most important lessons I learned are as follows:</p>
                    <h3>Working within parameters.</h3>
                    <p> When it comes to Get Tested- the time was of the essence, so getting the first version out that fit within the boundaries of the existing template was a challenge. It taught me how to design within the constraints of an existing bootstrap template. </p>
                    <h3>What is feasible. </h3>
                    <p>Over 30 people from around the world helped out at different stages. A majority of our choices on this project were dictated based on what we can develop at that particular time. </p>
                   <h3>Data changes.</h3>
                   <p>As we get more data, patterns start to emerge, and priorities began to shift. Things that didn’t seem important in the beginning start to dominate the decision making.
                    For example, based on the data that we had early on, we didn’t need to publish the paragraph info posted on each center’s site, as it was redundant. However, as we received more data, we learned that some centers are providing unique information, not listed anywhere else. So we redesigned to include it. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Flexibility.</h3>
                    <p class="nopad">This was a fast moving project, so a rigid process framework would have been detriment to our project. Therefore, maintaining flexibility while committing continuing research and following design principles was a key to the continuous improvement of the project.
